# Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis Lab
Our lab assignments focused on the use of classical data structure algorithms, and required low time complexity, thoroughness of consideration, and needed to be validated on ONLINE JUDGEMENT to ensure the reliability of the algorithms, which I passed with perfect scores on all of my assignments.
